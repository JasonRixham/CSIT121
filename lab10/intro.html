      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Social media is an important part of our lives today. Websites like Twitter (now called X, which I think is a bad name), Facebook 
        (not a fan), Instagram (also not great), and YouTube (a bright spot in a dark world) affect how we communicate, share information, 
        and connect with others. However, these platforms are owned by single companies, which control the servers, manage the algorithms, 
        and set the rules. This raises concerns about privacy, censorship, legitimacy, and monopolies.</p>
      <p>The solution to this issue is ActivityPub. This is an open protocol created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2018. 
        ActivityPub is not a social network; it is a set of rules that helps different social platforms talk to each other. This protocol 
        is the foundation of the Fediverse, a decentralized network of connected communities. Understanding ActivityPub is important for 
        imagining a future where the internet can be freer and more democratic.</p>     
      <p>ActivityPub is a protocol for decentralized social networking. A protocol acts like a language; if two computers understand the same 
        language, they can share information. ActivityPub makes it clear how social activities, such as posting, liking, following, and sharing, 
        should be shown. This common format allows any platform using ActivityPub to easily understand and handle these activities.</p>
