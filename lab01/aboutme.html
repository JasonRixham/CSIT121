            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am 45 years old and a nerd. I have 5 cats, enjoy cartoons, anime, and video games. 
                I like to cook and work out, and have always been interested in computers 
                and technology. I have buit quite a few computers and fixed more than I can count.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have a few skills and hobbies. I'm quite skilled in the kitchen; anything from risotto to apple pie, 
                I can make it. I'm also an amateur woodworker and enjoy experimenting with metalworking. I find using 
                and fixing computers to be relatively easy. Additionally, I occasionally brew my own beer and make hard cider.
