    <h3>Understanding that I have had</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML is enjoyable and less complicated than other programming languages I have studied in my classes.</li>
      <li>HTML is case-insensitive, meaning it doesn't matter if you write it as "html" or "HTML."</li>
      <li>The creation of HTML was in 1993. Old. I feel old.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some More Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Organization on a web page will make it much easier to create and troubleshoot.</li>
      <li>I'm certainly glad I don't program HTML for a living; it would be a fun hobby.</li>
      <li>Resources for HTML are abundant; it is probably one of the most established languages in computer history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stuff learned doing Lab 03</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML is an boring document without CSS.</li>
      <li>HTML so far, is very much easier to use than other languages I've learned.</li>
      <li>CSS is quite a lot of fun, like painting a webpage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lab 04/Lab 05 knowledge gained</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with HTML, CSS, and now JavaScript has been really fun; the creations you can make with this combination are amazing.</li>
      <li>JavaScript seems much more complex compared to HTML or CSS.</li>
      <li>Creating multiple CSS profiles for a single page can be more confusing than it seems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lab02 Reflections/Blog</h2>
    <p>Learning HTML was like gaining a superpower or casting magic; it allowed me to organize information, 
      create links between pages, and present content on websites with confidence. The experience of learning this language 
      introduced me to an exciting realm where creativity meets technology, giving me the ability to bring my ideas to life 
      online.</p>
   
    <h2>Lab03 Reflections/Blog</h2>  
    <p>When I started this assignment, I found HTML to be the foundational element of a webpage, 
      similar to constructing a car frame. When I explored CSS, I realized my webpages could have pretty and 
      vibrant colors and visually appealing aesthetics, much like the paint and interior of a car. HTML is the 
      structure, while CSS adds the paint and glitter to bedazzle your webpage. This combination elevates a simple 
      document into an engaging and attractive interface.</p>

    <h2>Lab04/Lab05 Reflections/Blog</h2>  
    <p>Lab04 was the first time i made menus and used some of the link capabilities of html, I also learned 
      alot about what links,images and video, do work for HTML and how to format the page to fit the links. Lab05 got more 
      into formating the web pages so mutliple css pages could work for the same basic instuctions. Their was quite a few chalenges 
      getting it to work it was fun to do. </p>
