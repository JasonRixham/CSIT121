    <p id="whitetext">This is my first real webpage, and I'm excited about it! So far, 
      I find HTML to be much easier and more enjoyable than Python. While the lessons in the 
      class were definitely helpful, I also found some external resources to be very beneficial.</p>

    <h3 id="rando1">Understanding that I have had</h3>
    <ul class="list1">
      <li>HTML is enjoyable and less complicated than other programming languages I have studied in my classes.</li>
      <li>HTML is case-insensitive, meaning it doesn't matter if you write it as "html" or "HTML."</li>
      <li>The creation of HTML was in 1993. Old. I feel old.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="rando2">Some More Takeaways</h3>
    <ul class="list2">
      <li>Organization on a web page will make it much easier to create and troubleshoot.</li>
      <li>I'm certainly glad I don't program HTML for a living; it would be a fun hobby.</li>
      <li>Resources for HTML are abundant; it is probably one of the most established languages in computer history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="rando3">New stuff learned since doing Lab 03</h3>
    <ul class="list3">
      <li>HTML is an boring document without CSS.</li>
      <li>HTML so far, is very much easier to use than other languages I've learned.</li>
      <li>CSS is quite a lot of fun, like painting a webpage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="lab2color">Lab02 Reflections/Blog</h2>
    <p id="blogage1">Learning HTML was like gaining a superpower or casting magic; it allowed me to organize information, 
      create links between pages, and present content on websites with confidence. The experience of learning this language 
      introduced me to an exciting realm where creativity meets technology, giving me the ability to bring my ideas to life 
      online.</p>
   
    <h2 id="lab3color">Lab03 Reflections/Blog</h2>  
    <p id="blogage2">When I started this assignment, I found HTML to be the foundational element of a webpage, 
      similar to constructing a car frame. When I explored CSS, I realized my webpages could have pretty and 
      vibrant colors and visually appealing aesthetics, much like the paint and interior of a car. HTML is the 
      structure, while CSS adds the paint and glitter to bedazzle your webpage. This combination elevates a simple 
      document into an engaging and attractive interface.</p>

  <h3 id="rando4">Feedback after I turned in my Lab02 assignment</h3>
    <ul class="list4">
      <li>Don't look too far ahead, it could burn you.</li>
      <li>Using knowledge from other classes/experineces is not always the best option.</li>
      <li>Be yourself, even if it feels like the wrong thing to do.</li>

    </ul>
