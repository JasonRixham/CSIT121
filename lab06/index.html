    <h3>What is the URL of the website?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>https://homebrewersassociation.org/</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is the name of the website? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>American Homebrewers Association</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who is the site's target audience? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The American Homebrewers Association brings homebrewers together, promoting education and curiosity within a community 
        where both beginners and professional brewers can access information, advice, and recipes for brewing excellent beer. 
        They are dedicated to creating an open community that nurtures new interests and builds confidence. They emphasize that
         "brewing goes beyond a hobbyâ€”it's a source of joy." </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How is the site organized? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The website is organized with the main page featuring highlighted stories and contests. It consists of two menus: 
</li>
      <li>The first menu includes links to membership information, recipes and instructions, as well as competitions and events. 
        Each tab in this menu has dropdown options.</li>
      <li>The second menu provides access to deals, supply shops, clubs, forums, and additional membership information. </li>
      <li>After navigating the website, users will find a classic scroll-down layout for viewing content. There are some floating ads, and a 
        significant portion of the page is built using JavaScript. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Which CRAP Design Principle does the use?</h3>
    <h4>Contrast</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>It uses dark text on a white background that enhances readability. Headlines are bold and large, while body text is 
        smaller and lighter, making it easier on the eyes. When using the drop-down menu, the drop down background remains white, 
        ensuring that the text is easy to read.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Repetition</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>Navigation is simple, as the top menu bar remains consistent across all pages, promoting familiarity. The design elements, 
        including icons, buttons, and section headers, maintain a uniform style, creating a sense of cohesion. The color scheme primarily 
        features black and white, while most color is reserved for images and banners, which are consistently used throughout the site to reinforce 
        brand identity.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Aligment</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>The menu layout is organized in two tidy rows at the top of the page, making it easy to navigate. The text and images, which mainly 
        include headings, paragraphs, and visuals, are consistently aligned to prevent clutter even in a smaller window. The navigation follows a 
        straightforward vertical arrangement, and the spacing is neatly aligned with the rest of the page, helping users find information quickly.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Proximity</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>Related items such as recipes, events, and membership information are grouped together. Adequate spacing between sections helps to prevent 
        visual overload and guides the user's focus. Links are placed near relevant content to promote interaction without causing confusion.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Audit Score</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessiblility score is 50.07. semi compliant.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h3>   
      <ul>  
        <li>Even though the site's accessibility rating is just above 50%, it is an effective website. The navigation and readability are good, 
            and there are no broken links or poor menu options. Moreover, there is no overlap of pictures or text and actions proceed without any 
            issues and are accurate.
</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?
</h3>   
      <ul>  
        <li>The engagement on the site is good, with easy access to information without any unnecessary obstacles. The layout is visually appealing, 
            featuring many attractive images that help maintain interest. Overall, the site has a professional look, making it suitable for a community 
            platform.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>   
      <ul>  
        <li>The only recommendation I can offer is to add more color to either the text or the background to break up the black and white.</li>
    </ul>
